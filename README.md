## Introduction
Code for event-based modality detection, as described in the ACL paper ["*The Possible, the Plausible, and the Desirable: Event-Based Modality Detection for Language Processing"*](to-be-updated). The code allows training, data processing, and includes configuration files for the experiments described in the paper.
